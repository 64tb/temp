You can go to the self-service portal and make a claim using the YOD reference number and the email you used when booking the parcel.

I apologise for the inconvenience. The driver is not permitted to call you. You can track your parcel in real time using the Yodel mobile application and have a better idea of exactly when your parcel is about to be delivered.

The parcel was not available in the store when the customer attempted to collect it.

I can see that the driver was out for collection today but was unable to collect the parcel. Please do not worry; I am escalating your concern to the team, and they will rearrange the collection of the parcel.

I apologise for the inconvenience. As your parcel's estimated delivery date is today and it is also scheduled to be delivered today, I would kindly request that you wait until the end of the day for your parcel to be delivered.

Thank you for your patience. You can redirect the parcel to another store using the Yodel mobile application.

The address I shared was provided by the sender.
